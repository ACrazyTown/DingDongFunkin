Sorry.

I kinda overshot how long this would take, and kept piling on ideas on top of the unfinished current ones and it just turned into a big mess.

This is a !! VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND PROBABLY BUGGY BUILD !!
Story Mode is disabled because it was never fully completed (as with 90% of the things)

Freeplay is enabled but most songs will lack effects, stages, and other stuff.

Videos are disabled cuz they broke and i didn't feel like fixing them, you can see what they were supposed to be
in the assets/preload/videos folder.

I hope you enjoy this mod.

As far as porting and stuff goes:
If you want to port this to another engine, I don't really care, as long as you credit Me (A Crazy Town), Dorbellprod, and the other wonderful people who helped me out here.
As of right now, I will not release the source code/FLAs, but if people want them I'll release them.

For any other questions, drop me a mention or DM on twitter or discord (@acrazytown on both)
