heya!!

thx for downloading the ding mod
i've spent quite a lot of time on it and i'm really proud of how it turned out.
this is just a "demo" or proof of concept if you will, and most of the assets are temporary and will be revamped once I release the 2.0 update.

I plan on releasing 1 more major update (maybe more we'll have to wait and see) and a few minor updates to patch bugs if neccesary.
so yeah
too many words, i'm gonna shut up now
enjoy the mod and thanks for downloading once again!!
