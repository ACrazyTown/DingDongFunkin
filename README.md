# DingDong's Funkin' | Friday Night Funkin': VS DingDongDirt

**[DingDong's Funkin'](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301335)** is a mod for **[Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371)** featuring the world famous small animator **[DingDongDirt!](https://youtube.com/c/dingdongdirt)**

Originally meant to be a shitpost mod, but accidentally grew into a huge ass mod with a huge ass storyline.

This mod uses DONUT 1.0, a highly modified version of **[Kade Engine 1.5.4](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine)**, an engine which removes the competitive focus of Kade Engine and reworks most of the code.

## Compiling
**Only C++/Desktop targets are supported!!! Can't run on HTML5/Mobile without major code changes!**

**NOTE: When testing, I used Lime 8.0.0, OpenFL 9.2.0 and HaxeFlixel 5.0.2, these are the only versions I'm SURE the game works on! Flixel 4.11.0 also works fine I think**

1. Install Haxe & Haxelib
2. Install hmm: `haxelib install hmm`
3. Setup hmm: `haxelib run hmm install`
4. Build the game: `lime test <target> (-debug)`
